      <td style="vertical-align: top; padding: 10px; border: 2px solid black;">Student Name: Lelyann Tran<br><br>Category Breakdown<br><br>Company and Industry Alignment:<br>- Job Description: Holst Architecture is a Portland-based design studio focused on the human experience of space in building designs, emphasizing environmental, social, and aesthetic ideals (JD lines 6-7).<br>- Applicant: Lelyann is a graphic design student at Portland State University, indicating a focus on design, but her primary interests lie in game/entertainment design, publishing, and tech industries, with no mention of architecture (SP line 4).<br>- Summary of Alignment: Lelyann's interests in graphic design and illustration do not align with the architectural focus of Holst Architecture and their mission (SP lines 4, JD lines 6-7).<br>- Alignment Score: 2.0/10<br><br>2. Job Role and Responsibilities vs. Applicant Experience:<br>- Job Description: The internship involves collaboration with design teams, participation in design charrettes, preparation of presentation materials, and working on drawings and documents (JD lines 10-14).<br>- Applicant: Lelyann has experience creating various design projects, collaborating on a website, social media campaigns, and illustration work, but these experiences center around graphic design rather than architectural design (SP lines 4, 8).<br>- Summary of Alignment: While Lelyann has relevant design experience, it is primarily in graphic design and does not directly relate to architectural responsibilities. Thus, her experience does not fully meet the job's requirements (SP lines 4, JD lines 10-14).<br>- Alignment Score: 4.0/10<br><br>3. Education, Skills, and Tools:<br>- Job Description: Candidates should be enrolled in an architecture program and ideally have knowledge of Revit, Sketchup, Microsoft Office, and Adobe Suite software (JD lines 23-26).<br>- Applicant: Lelyann is a graphic design student with a strong background in Adobe Suite and uses Microsoft Office, but lacks enrollment in an architecture program and specific architectural tools like Revit and Sketchup (SP lines 4, 7).<br>- Summary of Alignment: Lelyann possesses some relevant software skills, particularly in Adobe products, but lacks the necessary educational background in architecture and specific architectural software knowledge (JD lines 23-26).<br>- Alignment Score: 3.0/10<br><br>4. Values, perks, development opportunities, and Company Culture Alignment:<br>- Job Description: Holst emphasizes a collaborative culture with mentorship, knowledge-sharing opportunities, and a commitment to high environmental and aesthetic ideals (JD lines 6, 8-9).<br>- Applicant: Lelyann values feedback, collaboration, and a flexible working environment but primarily seeks opportunities in different industries such as gaming and tech (SP lines 4, 5).<br>- Summary of Alignment: Lelyann's values of collaboration and flexibility align somewhat with Holst's culture; however, her focus away from architecture indicates a disconnect with the company's mission and values (JD lines 6-7, SP lines 4, 5).<br>- Alignment Score: 5.0/10<br><br>Overall Alignment Score:<br>(2.0 + 4.0 + 3.0 + 5.0) / 4 = 3.5/10<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Lelyann Tran’s overall alignment with the architectural internship at Holst Architecture shows several areas of disconnect. While she possesses creativity and design skills, her experience is anchored in graphic design without direct relevance to architecture. Additionally, her educational focus does not meet the requirement for enrollment in an architecture program. Her values and skills have some relevance, but her desire to work in different industries reflects a significant misalignment with Holst Architecture's core focus.<br><br>Alignment Scores Summary:<br><br>Company and Industry Alignment Score: 2.0/10<br>Job Role and Responsibilities vs. Applicant Experience Score: 4.0/10<br>Education, Technical Skills, and Tools: 3.0/10<br>Values, perks, development opportunities, and Company Culture Alignment: 5.0/10<br>Overall Alignment Score: 3.5/10</td>
