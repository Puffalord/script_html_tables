        <h2>Task:</h2>
        <p>
            Your task is to see how well internship applicants align with a specific job. I will be sending you different student profiles (which include essays, resumes, and other information about the student), and job descriptions. You will compute an alignment score between the student profile and the job description. The alignment will be broken down into four categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Company and Industry Alignment</b></li>
            <li><b>Job Role and Responsibilities vs. Applicant Experience</b></li>
            <li><b>Education, Technical Skills, and Tools</b></li>
            <li><b>Values, perks, development opportunities, and Company Culture Alignment</b></li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="alignment-score-notes">
        <h3>Alignment Score Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You will also calculate the overall similarity score by averaging the alignment scores from each category.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="referencing-notes">
        <h3>Referencing Notes:</h3>
        <p>
            When analyzing the alignment between the job description and the student profile, reference the line numbers from which the information is taken.
            <br>
            Use the following format for referencing:
            <ul>
                <li>For information from the student profile, label it as <b>(SP line #)</b>.</li>
                <li>For information from the job description, label it as <b>(JD line #)</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><b>Examples of referencing:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If a student profile on line 5 states, "5. I am good with SQL," and the job description on line 17 mentions, "17. We need someone who knows SQL":
                <br><br>
                <i>Output:</i> "The student's knowledge of SQL <b>(SP line 5)</b> aligns well with the job's requirement for someone skilled in this area <b>(JD line 17)</b>."
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                If a student profile expresses a strong preference for working in the beauty industry, saying on line 3, "3. I really only want to work in the beauty industry," and the job description indicates the job is in the accounting industry on line 19 by stating, "19. This job is in the accounting industry.":
                <br><br>
                <i>Output:</i> "The student's desire to work in the beauty industry <b>(SP line 3)</b> does not align with the job's focus on the accounting industry <b>(JD line 19)</b>."
            </li>
        </ul>
